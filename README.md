# Block Outliner

**Block Outliner** is a Visual Studio Code extension that highlights code blocks enclosed in parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}` with colored outlines, making it easier to visualize and understand the code structure.

## Features

- **Highlights Code Blocks**: Identifies and highlights blocks of code enclosed in parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces with different colors.
- **Block Outlining**: Applies a border around entire blocks of code instead of applying decorations line by line.
- **Toggle Activation**: Enable or disable the functionality with a command.
